A personal voice assistant implementation in python

My first project learning python, and I wanted something fun to work towards, so what better than a personal voice assistant with wakeword detection that can actually do some useful stuff.

My environment for this project is Ubuntu 20.04 and Python 3.8 running on WSL2 on a Windows 10 machine, and I'm expecting to be able to port it to a Raspberry Pi in due course.

If you're interested in improving and building on this project, please fork it.
